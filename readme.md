* The Market is

    * Cooperative Sector 
        * Europe has over 170.000 cooperatives with an annual turn-over of more than €1000bn (Cocolina, 2016).
        * Many are already organised into sector-specific networks
        * Networks have existing conferences, events and communications channels

    * Our Partners are
        * CoTech is a network of technology cooperatives that operate on fully democratic principles. https://www.coops.tech/

        * Network of Radical Archives ~ The network of radical archives is a European wide initiative (with connections to India and the US) to coordinate and share resources amongst archives that look to preserve and record histories of social movements, experimental culture and marginalised figures and groups. http://norla.org/

* The Problem is

    * Co-operatives face a significant challenge of divesting from proprietary software and aligning their web infrastructure with the principles of self-organised, autonomous, and democratic collaboration. Outsourcing data storage to either corporate or non-commercial NfP initiatives ultimately means data assets and their derived knowledge is not in the hands of its creators.

* Our Solution is
    * Tech
        
        ![](https://i.imgur.com/sxBNwxG.png)

        * CoBox leverages the latest innovations in micro-computing, decentralised networking and data replication technologies for co-operatives to mutually host and seed secure data storage - the foundations of a peer-to-peer commons cloud infrastructure. 

        * Our software places privacy-by-design at the forefront of its innovation, using modern cryptography to ensure data sovereignty from the level of the individual to the co-operative and beyond.

        * CoBox provides an interoperable suite of tools for common coordination (decision-making, governance and accounting software), and offers integration for collaborative office software (documents, spreadsheets, calendars):

* Business Model
        
    * The CoBox business model is inspired by these projects:
           * SaaS: https://www.loomio.org/pricing
           * Optional hashbase: https://hashbase.io/pricing
           * Federation membership dues: https://mayfirst.org/en/membership-agreement/
            
---
    * Stakeholders include:
        * the cooperatives the purchase and deploy the CoBox cooperative cloud
            * coops can run independent or combined networks
        * the open source software projects that are pre-installed on the box (Dat, Loomio, Dark Crystal, Cobudget)
            * we are well network with these projects

* Metrics

     * Like the cooperatives that we aim to serve, CoBox will not be solely profit-driven. 
     
     * Our measurement metrics are adapted from other open source, p2p and cooperative community projects.

        1. Measuring peer-engagement and network growth:
            i. Increase in size of network
            ii. Increase in internal connectivity
            iii. Increase in connections to valuable third parties
            
        2. Measuring share ratio so peers can recognise their own contributions. 
        3. Happiness-unhappiness continuum will measure the health of peer relationships.
        4. Transparency of governance will evaluate the CoBox team's responsiveness and commitment to the network.
        5. Profit will be measured towards sustainable and self-sustaining growth.
