### The Problem

Co-operatives face a significant challenge of divesting from proprietary software and aligning their web infrastructure with the principles of self-organised, autonomous, and democratic collaboration. Outsourcing data storage to either corporate or non-commercial NfP initiatives ultimately means data assets and their derived knowledge is not in the hands of its creators.

---

### Our Solution
        

* CoBox leverages the latest innovations in micro-computing, decentralised networking and data replication technologies for co-operatives to mutually host and seed secure data storage - the foundations of a peer-to-peer commons cloud infrastructure. 

* Our software places privacy-by-design at the forefront of its innovation, using modern cryptography to ensure data sovereignty from the level of the individual to the co-operative and beyond.

---
### Our Solution

* CoBox provides an interoperable suite of tools for common coordination (decision-making, governance and accounting software), and offers integration for collaborative office software (documents, spreadsheets, calendars):

### Metrics

* Like the cooperatives that we aim to serve, CoBox will not be solely profit-driven. 
* Our measurement metrics are adapted from other open source, p2p and cooperative community projects.

---

### Metrics

- Measuring peer-engagement and network growth:
  - i. Increase in size of network
  - ii. Increase in internal connectivity
  - iii. Increase in connections to valuable third parties

---

### Metrics
- Measuring share ratio so peers can recognise their own contributions. 
- Happiness-unhappiness continuum will measure the health of peer relationships.
- Transparency of governance will evaluate the CoBox team's responsiveness and commitment to the network.
- Profit will be measured towards sustainable and self-sustaining growth.
